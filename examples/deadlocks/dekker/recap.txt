Dekker1:
Dekker1 deadlocks because it only allows someone to enter when no one
else has requested (essentially this is like the forall_other version,
except w/o a forall_other).

Fuzzer comments: if you let the fuzzer try to decide how many
processes are needed to fuzz this example, it will yell at you that it
has tried 6 different values of procs and they all deadlock.

Dekker2:
This one does not actually deadlock - at first glance it appears to
deadlock because once someone has req-ed, the previous person is
blocked. Except that the last person who did something will never be
blocked. So this version kills everyone except the last requester.

Buggy:
The original example with a forall that blocks the system as soon as
there are 2 reqs

Dekker_bug2:
Deadlocks for the dumbass reason that Req is never reset to false
