- Disjunctions of unsafe formulas

  Alain's idea: use a restricted form of disjunctions on terms

  	  T[z1] = A /\ (T[z2] = B \/ T[z2] = C)

	  --->

	  T[z1] = A /\ T[z2] = (B | C)
  

- Extend the syntax for arithmetic expressions

- Compute the tau function only once

- Improve the heuristic used for the generation of invariants

- Mix backward and forward reasoning (Amit, Sava ?)

- Benchmark Cubicle on other examples

- Taking advantage of the unsat cores returned by the SMT solver.

- Improve the concurrent computation of invariants
